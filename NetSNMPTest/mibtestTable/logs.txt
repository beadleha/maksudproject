My work log.

Today I tested the table interface for a test MIB named 'testmibTable'.
I was able to read the values from it. But I could not set values.

Previously I also created and tested some scalar function. But I was 
unable to set values to them. I have to look what should be done.


Task TODO:
1. I need to print the logs from snmpd.
2. An agentx integration must be done.
3. A work plan need to be devised to manage such a huge code.
4. 1/12/2008: Need to implement Table with RowStatus.
5. How to debug the code. probably from eclipse.


mibtestTable:
generate the code from
mib2c -c mib2c.mfd.conf mibtestTable


there is a potential bug in mibtestTable supplied from Don Tu. 
I fixed it by "netSnmpExamples 10"

the changes are marked with //Max

Changes are done in (as per DT) 
1. mibtestTable_data_access.c
2. mibtestTable_data_set.c
3. mibtestTable.c
3. mibtestTable.h

But Set is not working. Also initial values are not working.
It should be 
0 	100 	200
0 	-100 	-200

but I am getting 0 1 2, 0 -1 -2.... Have to see what is wrong.

I am working on 5.3.1 version. 
May need to switch to latest 5.4.1 version.
 
Probable task
1. Add database support to snmpd


Search for community option in net to set snmp value.
